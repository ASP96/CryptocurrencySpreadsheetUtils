The easiest way to use it is to make a copy of the spreadsheet above.

## Using

Add script in Tools > Script editor. Then to use, simply add =getCoinPrice("SYMBOL") in a row. For example, Bitcoin would be
    
    =getCoinPrice("BTC")
    
Ethereum would be

    =getCoinPrice("ETH")
    
Litecoin would be

    =getCoinPrice("LTC")       
 
Almost every crypto currency should work because data is fetched from coinbin.org API,
which has many and updates pretty regularly. Data is cached for 25 minutes.
